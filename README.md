## Assignment Description

**Problem Statement:**
Nonprofits often struggle to keep alumni engaged after their direct involvement with the organization ends. Even when groups experiment with different events, tools, or messages, results are often inconsistent and alumni gradually lose connection. The challenge is to identify practical and cost-effective strategies that can help Young Invincibles strengthen alumni relationships and build a lasting community over time.

**Problem Definition:**
Young Invincibles (YI) is directly affected by this lack of consistent alumni participation, but it also keeps alumni from benefiting from continued connection, and prevents current YI members from being a part of the larger community. The events that are commonly well attended are costly to YI, as alumni often don't have enough free time in their new careers to attend other events. Without consistent participation from alumni, YI will not be able to have the community feel and sense of belonging they want.

**Alumni Participation:**
The requisite motivation for humans to do something requires that the benefits they gain from the action are worth more than the cost of doing so. Ways that YI can benefit alumni include meeting new YI members, including a chance to mentor them, recognition and status ranks, access to exclusive YI events, and even gift cards.

**Gamification:**
In recent years, there has been an uptick in using gamification to drive consistent user engagement, finding viable use cases in education, community and civic engagement, and mass communication. This strategy has been proven effective when using techniques such as leaderboards, badges, and point systems.

## Project Overview: Visible Invincibles

Our proposal is to create an alumni portal within the YI website. It will use known, effective gamification techniques to encourage consistent alumni participation, recognize and reward active alumni allowing YI to focus higher cost events at active alumni, foster belonging and a sense of community through boards and mentorship programming, and keep alumni informed through its event calendar. This digital space should prove a cost-effective method of creating consistent participation and ongoing conversations and connections.

The examples provided below are just a handful of countless ways a gamified engagement system can keep Alumni motivated and highlight their achievements within YI. Even just the data that can be learned is an incredibly valuable tool to solve problems before they appear. This highly scalable solution can be implemented in less than a month, and the monthly cost of a database can be anywhere from the price of a cup of coffee, to entirely free. Let's embrace the tools we have to help alumni show their steps forward for impact with Visible Invincibles.

**Dashboard:**  
This is your entry into the new YI portal, giving you top level updates on what is happening such as upcoming events, highlighted political news, and the latest rankings on the national leaderboard using our gamified engagement point system.

**Profile:**  
The profile page is designed to showcase each alumni’s growth and impact in one place. Each profile page displays an alumni’s key information, along with their latest activity and engagement stats. Important data that provides YI incredible insight into each Alumni’s engagement. It also links directly to their social media profiles, making it easy for other alumni to connect and stay in touch beyond this platform. It also displays achievements, including total points, national ranking, activity streaks, and community engagement. This creates a clear snapshot of participation and progress over time.

**Activity:**  
Here users can monitor their recent activity and see completed tasks and progress. Alumni can earn points through a variety of means such as attendance, sharing YI posts, discussion participation and donations. Alumni can also earn various badges and certificates for milestone achievements to show their commitment.

**Events:**  
The calendar layout lets you instantly see what’s coming up, and the event cards show times, topics, and exactly how many points you can earn for participating or volunteering. With one click you can register, and the system automatically sends email reminders and post event feedback, keeping members engaged without extra effort. Overall, it makes getting involved simple, rewarding, and easy to keep track of.

**Community:**  
Here users can connect and discuss with like minded YI individuals you belong in the community page. Young Invincibles can foster belonging through the different communities within the website based around location, career focus and policy, with many other possibilities for communities.

**Leaderboards:**  
Your rank will change based on how many points you've earned throughout the season. These ranks can range from "Silver Advocate" to "Platinum Invincible". People can earn points either through participating in fun community events or donating directly to Young Invincibles! The idea is to naturally encourage friendly competition and provide a quick visual of everyone's engagement around the nation in one easy-to-access place.

**Rewards:**  
Here is an optional way to keep Alumni engaged. Rewarding their hard work by redeeming simple prizes such as gift cards or YI merchandise for showing their support. There are many possibilities for incentives to keep Alumni working towards their goals such as exclusive opportunities or spotlights for recognition.
