## Assignment Description

**THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
Nonprofits often struggle to keep alumni engaged after their direct involvement with the organization ends. Even when groups experiment with different events, tools, or messages, results are often inconsistent and alumni gradually lose connection. The challenge is to identify practical and cost-effective strategies that can help Young Invincibles strengthen alumni relationships and build a lasting community over time.
